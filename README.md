# Web Development Bootcamp

Personal notes taken from [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele. I wrote this while taking the bootcamp to reinforce my learning and to develop a single repository that contained all the important information, summarized for my reference.

## HTML

HTML deals with the **structure** of the web page, providing us with the content the page contains. We use _tags_ to define the HTML elements we are implementing to specify the type of our content.

_Tip: A great reference guide for HTML, CSS, Javascript and other technologies is [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). You can use it not only for reference, but it will also provide you with best practices and common industry methodologies for specific things._

### Semantic Markup

A recent development, semantic markup allows us to provide _meaning_ to the tags we employ when writing HTML. For example, rather than simply using `div` as a blanket, catch-all term for all of our generalized containers, we can use various similar tags like `nav`, `header`, `footer`, etc. While they perform the exact same function as `div`, they encapuslate much greater meaning within them, which is helpful not just for human code-readability, but also SEOs and other tracking services.

_Tip: Make sure to use **semantic markup** to create meaningful generalized containers like `nav`, `header`, etc. rather than using the catch-all `div` tag_
